## Features

- Lightweight
- No configuration
- Animated suffixes
- Visible to everyone
- Runs on every vanilla based server and singleplayer


## Installation
1. Stop the server
2. Paste `Status.zip` in the `datapacks` folder of your world in `/saves`\
    On servers, just paste it in the `world` directory
3. Start the Server
4. Enable it by typing `/datapack enable "file/Status.zip"`\
    If there nothing happens, run `/function firstuse:firststart`


## Examples

Let's say, I want to set the 'cute' status without animations.
```mcfunction
trigger Status set 69
trigger StatusAnimated set 1
```
Now, I want to completely disable the animation.
```mcfunction
trigger StatusAnimated set 2
```
Ok, how about clearing the status?
```mcfunction
trigger Status set 100
```

#### Note: all this can be done easily on the status panel (`/trigger Status`)

## Commands

#### Basics
*All of these commands can be accessed by anyone, using the status menu or the chat.*

| Command   | Description  |           
| :--------|:------------- |
| `/trigger StatusHelp` | Shows the **help menu** |
| `/trigger Statushelp set 2` | **Credits** |
| `/trigger Status` | Shows the **status menu** |


#### Teams
*These are the team ids, which can be inserted in the command below, to set your suffix.*
```mcfunction
  trigger Status set <ID>
```

|ID      | Suffix   | Animated  | Color
| :------| :------| :-------- | :--- |
| `5`    | `AFK` | ❌ | `gray` |
| `6`    | `Build` | ❌ | `aqua` |
| `69`    | `Cute` | ✅ | `light_purple` |
| `7`    | `Discord` | ❌ | `blue` |
| `8`    | `Discovering...` | ✅ | `dark_green` |
| `9`    | `Farm` | ❌ | `gold` |
| `10`    | `Live` | ❌ | `dark_purple` |
| `11`    | `NoNether` | ❌ | `dark_red` |
| `12`    | `Rec` | ❌ | `red` |
| `13`    | `Redstone` | ✅ | `red` |
| `14`    | `RP` | ✅ | `yellow` |


#### Utility
`/trigger Status set 100` to clear your status\
`/trigger StatusAnimated set 1` to allow animations\
`/trigger StatusAnimated set 2` to disable animations

#### Admin
*These are commands, only admins can access*

`/function setup:reinstall` hard resets all data and reboots the datapack
`/function setup:remove` reveals the remove-panel\
    1. Option: `/trigger StatusKeep` aborts the process\
    2. Option: `/trigger StatusRemove` deletes **everything** (almost)

To completely disable the datapack, run the commands above, then proceed with `/schedule clear firstuse:timefunc` to unload the schedule and `/datapack disable "file/Status.zip"` to disable autostart on reload.

#### Scoreboards
*The datapack needs some scoreboards, which are crucial to ensure funcionality and reliability*

|Scoreboard      | Function   | Trigger   |
| :------        | :------    | :-------- |
| `Status` | Manages the status requests | ✅ |
| `StatusKeep` | Only accessable after `/function setup:remove` | ✅ |
| `StatusRemove` | Only accessable after `/function setup:remove` | ✅ |
| `StatusTime` | Greets every player new to the datapack. Also a little playtime counter | ❌ |
| `StatusAnimation` | Manages animation frames | ❌ |
| `StatusHelp` | Help and credits menu | ✅ |
| `StatusAnimated2` | Stores information about who is using animations | ❌ |
| `StatusAnimated` | Toggle for animations | ✅ |
| `StatusWelcome` | Welcome back message | ❌ |
